## The-story
This app is and essessment for a school course. It's meant to test my understanding about node and the tools around it like git and npm. There is no focus on frontend or design it's just backend oriented. It doesn't mean for me that I would just make an app that pushes and reads data from an databse. I wantend to make something useful that is good looking. It should look like a real project. And maybe other developers could make their version from it. 

## The making of
So how did I started? I'm like a construction worker. I can't work without a blueprint. I need to know what I am going to make. So started with simple design in sketch. It helped me discover what pages I needed to make and how the database should look like. If you are interested in the design you can look [here](design/)
