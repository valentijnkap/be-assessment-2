# Places

This node app is an fictional social platform to share travel stories from different places. On this platform users can write stories about their journy and add pictures and even geo locations. Other users can read those stories and like them. It's an ongoing proces to improve my understanding of node.

## The-story
This app is and essessment for a school course. It's meant to test my understanding about node and the tools around it like git and npm. There is no focus on frontend or design it's just backend oriented. It doesn't mean for me that I would just make an app that pushes and reads data from an databse. I wantend to make something useful that is good looking. It should look like a real project. And maybe other developers could make their version from it. If you are interested in how I made this app then read the next section otherwise skip to the next [section](#usage). 

## The making of

### The beginning
So how did I started? I'm like a construction worker. I can't work without a blueprint. I need to know what I am going to make. So started with simple design in [sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). It helped me discover what pages I needed to make and how the database should look like. If you are interested in the design you can look [here](design/).

The last 8 weeks where tough weeks. I learned the basics with package's like http, path, fs and more. For the most part my skills where tested with the famous `express` package. So I created `[app.js](app.js)` and wrote the basics steps. Setup a template viewer, serve the static folder and define a port. That was going very well for me. But then came the hardest part so far for me. After creating the register page and style it. I had to make it function and send the data from the form to an database.

### MongoDB
At first I wanted to use an SQL database but after brainstorming with a classmate he advized me to use MongoDB. It's mutch faster than SQL and I don't need relationships with this app. And even if I need them I can still make relations with a document orienteded database. Plus I never worked with MongoDB or such databases so it's a good way to expand my horizon.

But when I started with MongoDB it was, if I may say so "A pain in the ass". I couldn't install MongoDB beceause I am running El Captain on my mac. There is an older version of Xcode on my mac and homebrew needs to newest to install MongoDB. I found a workaround for this problem on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48251108/mongodb-installation-failed-with-homebrew-and-xcode-8-1-1?rq=1). Then the next step.. 

Making an connection wasn't easy eather. But luckily my [teacher](https://github.com/wooorm) had an [example](https://github.com/cmda-be/course-17-18/blob/master/examples/mongodb-server/index.js) ready. There I found my way to make an connection to the database. I used the following code:

```javascript
var mongo = require('mongodb')

require('dotenv').config()

var db = null
var url = 'mongodb://' + process.env.DB_HOST + ':' + process.env.DB_PORT

// Make the connection
mongo.MongoClient.connect(url, function (err, client) {
  if (err) throw err
  db = client.db(process.env.DB_NAME)
})

// Use the connection
function registerUser (req, res) {
  db.collection('users').insertOne({
    username: req.body.username,
    name: req.body.name,
    place: req.body.place,
    email: req.body.email,
    password: req.body.password
  }, done)

  function done (err, data) {
    if (err) throw err

    res.redirect('/' + req.body.username)
  }
}
```

After couple of painfull days I came this far to make it work with an database. I found a way to get the stored data back into a template with this:

```javascript
function profile (req, res) {
  var user = req.params.username

  db.collection('users').findOne({
    username: user
  }, done)

  var meta = {
    title: user
  }

  function done (err, data) {
    if (err) {
      throw err
    } else {
      res.render('pages/profile.ejs', meta, {data: data})
    }
  }
}
```

The rest of my proces will follow later. I am not done yet.

## To do's
* [ ] Redirecting to profile page (make it load)
* [ ] Making a feed of all the story's
* [ ] Let users create new story's
* [ ] Adjusting the profile info and image
* [ ] Making a story page

## Usage

After cloning the code install the packages with:

*Install app*
```sh
$ npm install
```

The app is running on port `8000`

*Start app with*
```sh
$ node app.js
```
